✅ Semantic Elements

Example: header, footer, section, aside, navbar

❌ Non-Semantic Elements
Definition: Elements that do not describe their content. They are generic containers.
Example- div, span

================
Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
 elements are: <p> and <div>.

Inline Elements:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Example:
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
